Project Title: IdentifyMe – Get Yourself Verified 
Project Domain:Blockchain – Ethereum (Matic) Decentralized App + Web Development (Frontend)
Abstract:Every college has some way of differentiating their students from other colleges, most of them use what we know as “ID-Cards” – we want to digitalize it so that never again a student forgets his ID Card.
## introduction:
We want to revolutionize the way the system of authentication works for a college student.
Generally ID cards are made out of PVC Plastics which unfortunately WHO identifies as one of the “chemically related compounds that are persistent environmental pollutants (POPs)” but one’s doing anything to replace them. 
We see this as one of the important issue at hand and an attempt is made to completely remove the use of these PVC made ID Cards. We are moving towards digital cash, digital lockers, digital tracker of fitness, and so on – then why not a digital ID. 
We want to build a web app, which a college student can use in his/her campus as ID.
##Approach:
We are building a web app upon Ethereum (Matic) Technology, we’ll try to list out the points as we have planned out yet, but nothing’s fixed.

We aim our app to have a clean and elegant UI.We’ll be focusing on use of QR Codes which will act as their unique code (of each student)
The backend will run on the blockchain
An attempt to note the in-time and out-time will be made – (from/to the college for day scholars, and from/to the college and from/to the hostel for hostellers) which will stored in ledgers for future use.
To implement the above point, QR Code scanners will have to be placed at different locations of the campus, then it can serve as a entry card, say for example – libraries or study rooms, internet café – in & out time can also be noted with this – the students would not have to write in a register anymore.
The app will have no central authority – keeping this mind we tend to give user the minimal power to avoid misuse of the platform.
College authorities will have to help if they really want it to be implemented – for demo purposes we will have to use dummy IDs.
Libraries have large database and a librarian has to maintain heavy records too sometimes, through our app, the process of issuing books to students can be done in seconds.
As a future feature, we tend to also use our app for hosteller’s food coupons somehow – the exact details of this feature we aren’t sure, but it’s something we have in the back of our mind.
