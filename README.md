## Project Title: IdentifyMe – Get Yourself Verified 
Project Domain:Blockchain – Ethereum (Matic) Decentralized App + Web Development (Frontend)
Abstract:Every college has some way of differentiating their students from other colleges, most of them use what we know as “ID-Cards” – we want to digitalize it so that never again a student forgets his ID Card.
## Introduction:
We want to revolutionize the way the system of authentication works for a college student.
Generally ID cards are made out of PVC Plastics which unfortunately WHO identifies as one of the “chemically related compounds that are persistent environmental pollutants (POPs)” but one’s doing anything to replace them. 
We see this as one of the important issue at hand and an attempt is made to completely remove the use of these PVC made ID Cards. We are moving towards digital cash, digital lockers, digital tracker of fitness, and so on – then why not a digital ID. 
We want to build a web app, which a college student can use in his/her campus as ID.
## Teck stacks:
